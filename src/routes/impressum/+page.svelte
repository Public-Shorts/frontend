			Public Shorts is a 24/7 video festival taking place in Berlin from February 27 to March 15,
			2026.
		</div>
		<div>
			Throughout the festival, the entire curated selection plays on loop on screens visible through
			the glass windows at Kanapé (Hobrechstraße 54, 12047 Berlin), accessible to anyone passing by
			at any time of day or night.
		</div>
		<div>
			In addition to the continuous screening, we're hosting three special in-person events with
			Q&amp;As, debates, and discussions:

			experimental formats. The festival is curated by a diverse team of curators who collectively
			shape the selection through open call submissions.
