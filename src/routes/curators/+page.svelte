		<p class="text-zinc-300">
			Hi, if you’ve received this link, it’s because you’re invited to take part in the curation of
			the upcoming <i>Public Shorts</i> video festival.
		</p>

		<h2 class="font-bold">Public Shorts?</h2>
		<p class="text-zinc-300">
			We are putting together a video festival, which will stream 24/7 on screens inside the glass
			window of <a href="https://kanape.studio">kanapé</a>, which means that anyone could come and
			watch the shorts during the festival period
		</p>
		<div class=""></div>
		<p>
			On top of this, we will have 3 screening sessions with the different shorts, with Q&A,
			debates, etc.
		</p>
		<h2 class="font-bold">What does that entail?</h2>
		<p class="text-zinc-300">
			You’ll review submitted works, take notes (Phase 1), and join collective discussions (Phase 2)
			to shape the final selection. We're excpecting a lot of submissions so we are trying to gather
			a diverse and numerous group of curators so it remains manageable for everyone. We planned two
			physical meetings at Kanapé in Berlin to facilitate discussions and final decisions.
		</p>
