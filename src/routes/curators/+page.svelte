			Public Shorts: Video Festival in Berlin 2026, Curated by <i>you?</i>
		</h1>

		<p class="">
			Hi, if you’ve received this link, it’s because you’re invited to take part in the curation of
			the upcoming <i>Public Shorts</i> video festival.
		</p>

		<h2 class="font-bold text-zinc-100">Public Shorts?</h2>
		<p class="">
			We are putting together a 24/7 video festival, which will take over the screens inside the
			glass window of <a href="https://kanape.studio">kanapé</a>, anyone passing by could come and
			watch the shorts throughout the festival period.
		</p>
		<p>
			On top of this, we will host three in person screening sessions of a selected series of
			shorts, with Q&A, debates, discussions etc.
		</p>
		<h2 class="font-bold text-zinc-100">What does that entail?</h2>
		<p>
			As a part of the curatorial team, you’ll review submitted works, take notes, and join
			collective discussions to shape the final selection. We're expecting a lot of submissions and
			trying to gather a diverse and numerous group of curators so it remains manageable for
			everyone. We planned two in person meetings at Kanapé in Berlin to facilitate discussions and
			final decisions. To have an internal structure we planned two phases for the curation process:
		</p>
		<p>
			Phase 1: watch and take notes on the videos assigned to you. The initial selection happens
			already here.
		</p>
		<p>
			Phase 2: participate in group viewings and discussions to finalize the selection. It would be
			nice to participate to at least 1 session.
		</p>
