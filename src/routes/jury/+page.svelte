			Public Shorts: Video Festival in Berlin 2026, Curated by <em>you?</em>
		</h1>

		<p class=" text-gallery-700">
			Hi, if you’ve received this very secret link, it’s because you’re invited to serve on the jury
			of the upcoming <span class="italic">Public Shorts</span> video festival.
		</p>

		<h2 class=" text-gallery-700 text-xl font-semibold">What is Public Shorts?</h2>
		<p class="">
			We are organizing a 24/7 video festival, which will take over the screens inside the glass
			window of
			<a href="https://kanape.studio/" class="text-blue-600 underline">kanapé</a>. Anyone passing by
			can come and watch the shorts throughout the festival period.
		</p>
		<p class="">
			In addition, we will host three in-person screening sessions featuring a selection of shorts,
			including Q&amp;As, debates, discussions, and more.
		</p>

		<h2 class=" text-gallery-700 text-xl font-semibold">What does this entail?</h2>
		<p class="">
			Our curatorial team handles pre-screening, categorizing, and note-taking for all submissions
			(hopefully, there will be many!). That’s Curation Phase 1. As a jury member, you are welcome
			to participate in this phase if you wish, but it’s not mandatory.
		</p>
		<p class="">
			<span class="font-semibold">Curation Phase 2:</span> This is when your presence is needed. In two
			events, with the support of the curators, we’ll watch and discuss the submissions together. As
			a jury member, you’ll help make the final selection for the screenings. You are also invited to
			moderate the screening session of your curated selection, if you wish.
		</p>
